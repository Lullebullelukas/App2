Only a small part of the spex ensemble is on stage, which means there is plenty to do even for those who don't want to be in the spotlight. Rehearsals usually last 3-5 weeks during the semester, and depending on the size of the spex, a number of performances are then put on for both Lund students and the public.\n\nThe four largest spexes in Lund, all of which hold their performances in the main hall of the AF-borgen, are Jesper, Toddy, Boel and Lundaspexarna. Jesper is the technologist spex and is mainly aimed at technologist students, Toddy is mainly for medical students, Boel has only women on stage, and Lundaspexarna has only men on stage.",
